# java
This project has implementation of data structures such as arrays, stacks, lists and queues in Java. I tried to use data abstractions by applying object oriented programming concepts in Java. If you are interested to learn more about Java & data structures, or interested to do peer programming with me, you can send me an email to join my slack channel **#java** on my slack work space **womencodersworkspace.slack.com**.
